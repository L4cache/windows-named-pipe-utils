========================

Windows commands for interfacing named pipes with stdio streams.

Synopsis
--------

### `createAndReadPipe`: Get stdin from a new named pipe

*   Substitute your receiving program for `md5sum > out.tmp`.
    *   Redirecting `stdout` like this is optional, but
        `createAndReadPipe` prints its own status messages on stderr,
        which can mix with the program's output in unfashionable ways.
*   Substitute your sending program for `seq 20`.
    *   The sending program need not start after the pipe is open nor
        terminate when it is closed, but it must not attempt to open the
        pipe before it is created.
    *   Use of `stdout` is optional. The pipe path can be opened for
        write just like a regular file in most situations (such as with
        `fopen()` or `CreateFile()`, or by way of redirection like in
        this example).

On one console:

    rem Create pipe and read to another program
    createAndReadPipe MyPipeName | md5sum > out.tmp

On another console:

    rem Use another program to write to (and close) the pipe
    rem The pipe path is `\\.\pipe\` followed by the name passed to
    rem `createAndReadPipe`. Input to the pipe is received on `stdin` by the
    rem receiving program.
    seq 20 > \\.\pipe\MyPipeName

Build
-----

This has been successfully built on [MinGW and MSYS](http://mingw.org/)
with GCC 4.8.1. The resulting binary does not depend on DLLs not already
distributed with Windows.
